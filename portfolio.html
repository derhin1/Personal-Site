        <h4>Personal Site</h4>
        <p>
          Developed a personal website to demonstrate my understanding of basic
          HTML and CSS. On the website you can navigate to three seperate pages,
          where you will find styled header and footer, as well as content about
          me. As you can see the site is very basic right now but I plan to add
          more to it as I learn more!

        <p>
          Developed an e-commerce website where I was given what the design and
          layout of the site was supposed to look like and my task was to
          recreate it. This project tested my knowledge using flexbox and all of
          its properties, as well as using CSS pseudo-classes. Media queries
          were also used to hide certain or show certain elements depending on
          the size of the window.
        </p>
        <p>The links can be found here: <a class="siteLinks" href="https://serene-archimedes-8526f6.netlify.app/">Orginal website</a> and <a class="siteLinks" href="https://serene-archimedes-8526f6.netlify.app/">my work.</a></p></p>

        <p>
          It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
          readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
          using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
          letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it
          look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
          page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
          search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
          infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
          accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
