        I have been playing video games since I was a kid and they have been a
        big part of my life. One of my favorites is League of Legends because of
        its replayability. League of Legends is an ever changing game where no
        two games are the same. The enemy team and your team are both random
        variables and that impacts how the game plays out. That being said, it
        doesn’t mean that who wins is a coin flip, I love the game because it is
        up to you and your team to work together to overcome the challenges that
        may arise.

        In a similar vein, I also love playing board games with my friends. An
        ideal night for me would be a gathering with friends and just playing
        board games. There are many genres for board games and I honestly love
        playing and learning any kind. For example, I was recently given a board
        game called Gloomhaven. It is a massive game with the box weighing
        almost twenty pounds! The rules were also just as complicated as you’d
        imagine a twenty pound box would be but I loved every second of trying
        to learn the game with my friends. As I mentioned above, I do very much
        enjoy cooperative games where you work together with your friends,
        however the competitive side of me also enjoys playing board games where
        you compete with each other.

      <h4>Puzzles</h4>

      <p>
        Puzzles are something that I enjoy struggling through. It is always
        satisfying finally figuring something out after being stumped for a long
        time. One example that I have recently been playing is a daily word game
        called Wordle that can be found
        <a class="siteLinks" href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">here.</a>
        The goal of the game is to figure out what the five-letter word of the
        day is, however the catch is that you only get six attempts. Whenever
        you input a word it will tell you whether certain letters are used in
        the word of the day and if they are, if the position of the letter is
        right or not. I have been loving the game because my friends and I have
        been competing to see who can figure out the word in the least number of
        tries.
      </p>
      <p class="extraParagraphs">
        Another example of puzzles that I love are escape rooms. Escape rooms
        are locations that you go to where they put you and your friends in a
        “locked” room and the only way to escape is to solve a series of puzzles
        before a set time limit which is typically an hour. I enjoy these rooms
        because when you first enter a room it can be almost overwhelming how
        many puzzles there are in a room but after solving some, everything else
        starts to make sense. It is a lot of fun to do these with friends and I
        highly recommend it to anyone that hasn’t tried it yet!

      <h4>Climbing</h4>
      <img

      <p>
        Occasionally I like to go climbing! I personally find it a lot more
        engaging and fun than doing a regular workout. Climbing gyms have a
        large variety of different walls and each of them can have multiple ways
        to scale the wall up such as only being able to use green rocks.
        Climbing is neat because there is a lot more technique to it than one
        might think. I am definitely not a strong person however that doesn’t
        stop me from being able to climb. I use my hands to keep myself balanced
        while I put my foot on a higher hold and then push up with my legs to
        climb. This won’t work on every wall or challenge as some do and will
        require you to pull yourself up however this is where having a belayer
        is nice! Not only do they keep you safe by preventing you from falling
        but they also allow you to rest mid-climb as they can hold you in place.
